## Examples of Readability Analyses
The Readability Checker will provide an analysis of the selection. Text with good readability tends to have short sentences, with simple words (Figure 1). Text with medium readability (Figure 2) and poor readability (Figure 3) will have longer sentences and more complex words.If a very small amount of text is entered, the checker may provide unusual scores due to the small sample size.<br /><br />
**Note:** This version of the Readability Checker may produce slightly different results from the Java version because of differences between the RegEx implementations and because the Java version uses an HTML editor instead of a text editor.
